Set of Matlab codes from various lectures

# Bayesian Statistics

- bayesian_bino.m (Bayesian Parameter Estimation of a Binomial Distribution)
- bayesian_poiss.m (Bayesian Parameter Estimation of a Poisson Distribution)

- trapezoidal_rule_nd_integral.m (function for N-dimensional numerical integration. Author: Mohammed S. Al-Rawi, IEETA, University of Aveiro Portugal)

- model_selection_example.m (performs Model Selection on 'tumor animal Fig2.txt', data taken from DOI:10.1093/carcin/23.3.511, calls trapezoidal_rule_nd_integral.m)

- mean_var_analysis_example.m (performs Model Selection on 'LinaData.mat': WT vs treated mice, returns odds ratio and compares result to standat t-test. Data with permission from Dr. Lina Wendeler)

- VarBayesExample.m (estimating mean and variance and calculates corresponding probability density distributions using Variational Bayes, calls same data set as above)

- jumpGraph.m & jumpGraphRandom.m (illustrates temporal changes of states on a graph network with fixed rates and randomly generated rates which get multiplied with the adjacency matrix; calls axesArea.m, prh.m and wgPlot.m. Last three functions have been created by Michael Wu waftingpetal@yahoo.com)


# Biophysics - ODEs for non-linear systems



# Biophysics - Stochastic Processes

- random_walk.m  (simple illustration of a random walk)

- biased_random_walk.m (simulates trajectories of N E-coli following a food concentration gradient)

- diffusion_reaction.m, diffusion_reactionII.m, diffusion_reactionIII.m (different examples for pattern formation like fur, scales etc)

- twoDdiffusion.m (generic example)

- twoDdiffusion_smoluchouski.m (diffusion with drift i. e. Smoluchouski equation)
